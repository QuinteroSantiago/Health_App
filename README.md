# Health_App
Health application that automizes diet and workout routine to increase ease of access to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Working on two main functions to test which one is the better fit for today's consumers. 

## Diet Provider (Primary Function)
MVP - Using linear search and vector analysis to determine the best diet based on user's macro nutrient needs.

User Experience - Using function to find a diet based on their calories and proteins.

Current version works with database provided by us. Future installations will use databases customized by the user. Hopefully we will have a Gordon Ramsey exclusive recipe list. A database that keeps updating everyday is essential for this project to work

In future versions, we will also work with supermarkets to make customized shopping lists based on the users diet plan.

## Workout Routine
MVP - Depending on user's needs

In the future, the user will be able to customize what type of equipment does their gym have and this function will adjust their routine accordingly.
